# Overview

The players are teachers in a farmer's school. They prepare materials, recruit students, teach them, then graduate students to throw them to hungry and angry cooks who threatens to eat the front door. Each Student learn farming technique depending on when the teacher taught them as each season is different. But beware, the cooks wants very specific skillset. The players may have to teach carefully to meet their expectation. Moreover, they won't be forthcoming with what they want, and the player will have to spend time looking into the matter.

## Hungry Cook

The cook has an impatience meter (linked to the difficulty). At the start, this impatience is one full year. The impatience meter is empty when they arrive at the front door. For each season that pass, the impatience grows. If it is full, the hungry cook begins to eat the door. 

## No more materials

Once the materials/supply/... are empty, students won't learn anything, even if they already begun to learn something.

# Workstations

## Prepare materials/Supply

This station is needed to have everything else running smoothly. They are squattered around, and can accumulate a bit of backlog before beginning to means trouble. However, if none of the players take care of them, and materials are empty, no student will learn anything.
Fall is better to prepare materials

Ideas of variation: supply, materials, clothes, tools, paper, book, pens, ...
Some variation could be better to do in other seasons.

## Recruit students

This station is needed to have new students to teach to. Once you have a student, you can bring them to be an apprentice to the one already in formation. You have a limited pool of students to recruit from.
Fall is better to recruit students.

## Teach students

Players can only teach to one of the three main students in the classroom at a time. Player can only teach the current season. It takes most of the season to teach one main student the skill of the current season. Once they have mastered the skill, they teach their current apprentice too.
Materials and supply are needed to teach.

## Graduate students

Instead of teaching one of the main student, that student can be graduated, to go to the service of the current hungry cook. The student disappears. \
The hungry cook has a list of skills needed. For each skills the student has, the cook remove it from the requirements. When the cook has no more requirements, they leave. If the student had more skills than what the cook wanted, too bad, it's discarded. \
More than one graduate can go to appease a Cook.
Summer is better for graduating students.

## Repair front door

This station is to restore some dignity to the poor door eaten by ravenous cook. 
Spring is better for repairs.

## Divination about future Cook Requirements

This station helps to know the next cook requirement. It needs to be done to know even the one currently at the door. It can be stacked to show next Cooks too.
Winter is best for Divination
